  leftData: "Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun making it the most distant
    in the solar system. \n\nThis gas giant planet may have formed much closer to
    the Sun in early solar system history before migrating to its present position.
    It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed in 1846. Its position
    was determined using mathematical predictions. It was named after the Roman god
    of the sea."
