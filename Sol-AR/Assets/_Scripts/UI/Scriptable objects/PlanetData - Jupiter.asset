  leftData: "The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet out from the Sun, and is two and
    a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined.\n\nIt
    is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a \x1Cgas giant\x1D. One
    of Jupiter's most famous features is the Great Red Spot. It is a giant spinning
    storm, resembling a hurricane. At its widest point, the storm is about 3 1/2 times
    the diameter of Earth."
